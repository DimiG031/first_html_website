    <h1>Kopaonik National Park</h1>
    <h3>
        Kopaonik owes its name to its abundance of mineral resources.
        To this day, ores of iron, lead and zinc, as well as silver and gold,
        can be found in the bosom of the mountain.Today, Mt. Kopaonik is the number 
        one ski resort in Serbia and the wider region, attracting those who pack uo their 
        gear and hit the road at first sight of snow, on the hunt for the adrenaline rush 
        they are sure to get from Kopaonik’s slopes, even if just for the weekend.However,
        Kopaonik is equally bustling with life in the summertime. 
        Because of its plentiful annual sunshine, it has been dubbed “the sunshine mountain”.
        Still, ski enthusiasts need not worry: the peaks and valleys of Kopaonik are covered
        with snow from November to May.
